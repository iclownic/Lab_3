# Lab 3
**Classes and Objects. Constructors and Destructors. Modifiers.**

### Task 1:
Create a class description for a set. It stores elements of the set of integer type. Methods: element belonging to the set, add element, delete element, whether the set is a subset of the given set, equality (inequality) of two sets, union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference of two sets. Make the class properties private, and create getter methods for reading them.

### Task 2:
Create two methods in the previous task using JSON serialization and deserialization:
+ Method 1. Saves the created object of the class from Task 1 to a JSON file.
+ Method 2. Opens a JSON file with data and creates an object of the class with this data to perform Task 1
